<h3> Data </h3>

<h6> I am looking at the political ads run by the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates over 2019. The data comes from the <a href = "https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/home">Google Political Advertising Transparency Report</a>, which records all political ads run on the website, along with information on the ads themselves, the advertisers, and the political campaigns. </h6>

<h6> My goal is to see how political ads run on Google can affect candidates' polling results. I focused on Democratic primary polls, rather than general election polls, to get a better sense of how Democratic candidates were faring against each other and whether ads were raising their national profiles. I got this data from <a href = "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/">FiveThirtyEight</a>.</h6>

<h3> Me </h3>

<h6> I'm Michelle Gao, a Harvard junior studying government and statistics. I'm interested in the ways data can provide new insight into old questions.</h6>
